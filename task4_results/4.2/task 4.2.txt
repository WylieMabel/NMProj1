QAP can only test statistics that can represented by dyadic dependence: for example homophily can be represented with a matrix where the values for each row and column (therefore combination of two nodes) are 1 for homophile nodes and 0 for non-homophile nodes. More complex structures that take into account more than two nodes (Markov and/or partial conditional dependence) can only be represented with ERGMs. One such example is popularity: the tendency of high indegree nodes to receive even more ties. This results in a skewed in degree distribution (see preferential_degree_distribution.png), and a structure similar to a preferential attachment model, where as we can see in the figure (preferential_attachment_model.png) "hubs" can appear with a large indegree and smaller peripheral nodes. To test for popularity we would approach it as in the previous tasks by counting the number of 2-istars by using the formula shown in figure (star_formula.png) and using it as statistic in ERGM as done in task 3.
